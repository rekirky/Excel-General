=IF(VLOOKUP(C2,PROD_20180710.csv!$B:$B,1,TRUE)=C2,VLOOKUP(C2,PROD_20180710.csv!$B:$B,1,TRUE),NA())

Broken down:
=IF(
    Vlookup,VALUE,RANGE,1,TRUE) = VALUE
        Vlookup, VALUE,RANGE,1,TRUE
        NA()
      ) 


The TRUE tag on a vlookup is not as precise, if there is a chance of positive value it will loop through again to double check. On large datasets its quicker to find two possibles to make a definite than analyse each cell for a definite 
If not found it returns a N/A# error, this can be tweaked accordingly.
